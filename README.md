# imageFlipperJs
This is a JavaScript project I just completed . It is a collection of images from each of the Canadian provinces. 
You click on the nav bar buttons and it uses javaScript functions to change(flip) the image to an image related to that particular 
province. 
It is fully responsive to screens sizes:
480px, 600px, 768px, 1024px & 1200px
